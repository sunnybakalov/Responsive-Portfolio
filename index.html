                <p>My name is Staniel Bakalov. I was born and raised in Sliven, Bulgaria. I came to the United States
                    when I was 10 years old. I've called Utah my home for the past 16 years. I lived in Sandy for 12
                    years and have lived in Bluffdale for the last 4 years. My wife and I have a 2 year old boy and are
                    expecting another baby in April 2019!</p>
                <p>My hobbies include: working out, hiking, photography, cars, and shooting. I enjoy watching The
                    Office, drawing, editing photos, and watching Disney/Pixar movies with my son when I am not doing
                    something active. Some of our favorite Disney/Pixar movies are: Coco, Zootopia, and the Despicable
                    Me series.</p>
                <p>I am currently employed at Podium as an account development manager. I love the company that I work
                    for, but my goal is to get out of sales and elevate my career. I am aiming for the top and want to
                    be a software engineer for our company. I feel very passionate about the software that Podium
                    offers and I have really enjoyed being a part of the awesome culture here. </p>
                <p>I would love to continue working here for a long time. Never did I think I could find a workplace
                    that is truly invested in my happiness and into developming my career. I hope that the bootcamp
                    will help me with the necessary tools to succeed in my company.</p>
